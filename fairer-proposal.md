# Stakeholder-Governed Sound Money for a Fairer Financial System

## Summary of changes

The tagline would change to: Stakeholder-Governed Sound Money 

This proposal would add a new element to the explanation of Decred on decred.org: **Fair**

This theme will have a box on the front page and its own page, as with Secure, Adaptable and Sustainable.

You can see these changes mocked up (without new graphics) on a test site [here](https://dcrweb.jamieholdstock.com/).

## Supporting work

The extra box on the home page would need a background graphic, and the Fair page would need three images, plus an explainer video to be consistent with the other pages.

The new elements follow existing patterns so the amount of work needed to add them on the site is small.
