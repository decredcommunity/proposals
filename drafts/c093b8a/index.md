Dear Community,

I would like to share an early draft for the Decred Content and Asset Translation proposal to collect any an all feedback regarding this initiative.

Please, do not be alarmed if you think this proposal is lacking in some details or half-baked, as it is an early draft intended to measure stakeholder and community sentiment and take into account your feedback before formally submitting it to either be accepted or rejected on our Politeia Proposal Platform.

The proposal is the result of formally putting certain existing project-related activities up for a stakeholder vote. Should it get rejected, I am sure that said activities will continue, albeit at a reduced pace and on a purely voluntary basis.

Apart from trying to collect feedback and provide information on areas of the proposal the community will no doubt have questions about, the reason why I am putting up this pre-proposal draft is purely because I feel that I myself am in no position to try and dictate the fine details of this proposal, but would rather work it out in a public forum together with the contributors involved in it and the Decred community at large.

The key issues I feel require addressing the most are:

* do the stakeholders feel such an initiative is beneficial for Decred and worth funding in the first place? If so, is the presented scope satisfactory?
* what % of the base budget is to be allocated extra in case there is more work to be done in the areas outlined in the proposal than suggested by the data from the past 6 months?
* should there be a hard cap on translation efforts billing per contractor per month that is not to be exceeded rather than/together with a maximum hard cap budget for the duration of the proposal?

Again, I apologise for the quality of this draft, as I must admit I never thought I would be writing it in the first place, but the circumstances have determined that if the work in this area is to continue, and I hope you think, as I do, that it is an area worth pursuing, that a formal proposal putting to a vote must be submitted and I stepped up to the task despite my lack of experience.

I hope to answer questions to the best of my ability and availability within the next few days, as I hope my fellow contributors will do, too, and that we'll have a constructive discussion.

The proposal draft follows below:

## What

This proposal is a long overdue attempt at gauging the sentiment of Decred stakeholders towards translation efforts of Decred-related (and produced) content and assets and providing funding for said efforts in order to make all activity in this domain more formal, transparent, and controllable by the stakeholder community.

The issue of project-related content translation has always been a contentious one, with problems ranging from:

* who should be allowed to bill for work in this particular domain,
* what the contractor rate for work performed in this domain should be, if different from the standard contributor rate
* which languages the community should look at to have the content translated into in order to provide the best return for the money reception and reach-wise,
* which pieces of Decred-related content would offer the best value for money if disseminated to a wider audience
* whether to sponsor translation work at all, or if translation efforts should be performed at a strictly voluntary basis

Nevertheless, despite the issues outlined above, translation efforts performed according to some rules achieved by rough consensus and billed to the Treasury have continued. This proposal serves as an effort to try and firmly define the rules, scope, and budget for the efforts in question.

It has been agreed that the majority of crowd-sourced solutions for the translation of Decred assets attempted in the past was sub-par in terms of quality. Though the linguistic acumen might have been present, some individuals' lack of alignment with the project vision and work ethos combined with quick profit as the main motivator and difficulty in getting deliverables quality reviews made for overall rather disappointing results.

The interim solution from that point has been one in which contributors with foreign language knowledge, established in other domains, would be tasked with performing necessary translation work for the benefit of the project. Said contributors were also granted a degree of discretion in terms of translation contributions they could bill the project Treasury for, and this proposal is an attempt at formalising and bringing more transparency to this process.

## Why

It is our belief that apart from making Decred-related content and assets available to non-English speakers, thus extending the reach of the project vision and messaging, it is a key aspect of community building and strengthening, allowing cryptocurrency enthusiasts from around the world to take part in building project awareness and helping it spread its message. It is for this reason that we would like for work in this area to continue in some shape or form, because we believe that creating a collection of easily-accessible and reusable assets helps penetrate regional discussions on social media, build project recognition, helps showcase the Decred contributor model for non-development areas of contribution, and project a unified presence in international crypto media in terms of release news and coordination.

## How

The proposal seeks to establish a mostly discretionary budget for translation in a few recognised areas, such as:

* the Decred Journal (continuous)
* website translation (as required)
* software localisation (Decrediton, mobile wallets, etc., at the contributor's discretion)
* video assets translation (at the contributor's discretion)
* articles/content translation (at the contributor's discretion)

In order to give an idea of scale of these efforts currently being undertaken I have asked some contributors listed below to share some data on translation work performed for their respective languages **over the last 6 months**. I present this data broken up into categories listed above as averages per month, unless stated otherwise:

* the Decred Journal (average for Spanish, Polish, Chinese and Arabic) - **\\~9 hrs per issue** (NOTE: funding for Decred Journal translation for Spanish comes from the separate [LATAM activities proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/3c02b67), so the actual average without Spanish works out to **8,5 hrs per issue**)
* website translation (average for Arabic, Polish, and Chinese) - **7 hrs** (this is **not** an average per month, but for the most recent website update)
* articles/content translation (average for Arabic, Spanish, and Chinese) - **\\~3,5 hrs per month**
* video content translation (average for Spanish and Chinese) - **\\~16,5 hrs per month**
* software localisation (average for Polish and Chinese) - **6 hrs** (**not** an average per month, but a total)

Going with a rough cost for said activities over the last 6 months and using the standard contractor rate the rough average per month over said period of time comes out to **2235 USD** for the total of **around 13,410 USD** over the last half a year. Please note that had work in the above areas been done for all of the listed languages the end figures would be different, and likely not conform to the calculated averages. The averages served as a rough extrapolation point for how much it would cost to expand the initiative by a language based on existing data. Also, there have been other pieces of translated content, contributed either occasionally, irregularly or free of charge, therefore the total amount of translation hours contributed is probably higher than the one given, but nevertheless some kind of baseline is necessary for budget calculation reasons.

## Who

For the last several months there have been several contractors who have been contributing translated content for Decred at, at least, a semi-regular basis. Those are:

* @kozel ([Polish](https://medium.com/@artikozel))
* @arij (Arabic)
* @francov\\_([Spanish](https://medium.com/@francovdcr)), @pablito, @nachito
* @Dominic (Chinese)
* @mm ([Portuguese](https://stakey.club/pt/translated/))

The track record for individual contributors and their translation efforts has been meticulously documented in the [Decred Journal](https://xaur.github.io/decred-news/).

The translation budget would go towards contractor hours for providing translation work in languages listed above and possibly expanding the list for other languages should the stakeholders be interested in growing this initiative.

## When

The proposal would cover translation efforts for a period of 6 months, after which a report summarising the proposal spending would be produced so that the potential follow-up proposal to continue the programme could be supplied with more accurate spending projections.

**Total budget:** base budget of **16,000 USD** for the next 6 months + a % for \"unknown unknowns\" potentially to do with increased workload due to scheduled new releases. Any and all funds not spent by the end of the proposal's duration will remain in the project Treasury.
