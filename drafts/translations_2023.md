## What

This proposal seeks to continue the translation of Decred-related content, software, and assets in 2023.

This proposal is a summary of the third [Decred Content and Asset Translation Proposal (Phase 3)](https://proposals.decred.org/record/7057e0b) that was submitted in late May 2022 and expired at the end of the same year. It is also a formal submission to continue the translation initiative for Decred-related content and assets. If you are unfamiliar with the problems the abovementioned proposal aimed to propose solutions for, we encourage giving the [original proposal](https://proposals-archive.decred.org/proposals/c093b8a), as well as [its summary and resubmission](https://proposals.decred.org/record/af9942a) a read, because as a continuation of this initiative the core goals remain the same even if our application of work effort changes slightly from phase to phase and continues to evolve in order to respond to feedback and react to new challenges better.


## Summary of phase 3

Once again, we are delighted to inform that of the **$20,000** requested for the budget of phase 3 of the proposal the contractors who took part in bringing it to fruition made use of **$11,355.33**, bringing the spending significantly under budget for the **third** time.

The majority of the budget spend went towards continuous translation of the Decred Journal, updates to the website, updating existing translations of the DCRDEX and Dcrediton, as well as introducing new ones, like Greek and German. The output of translated articles and videos was very low, mostly due to the fact that during the course of one of the earlier proposals it had been decided that, at that time, with the video content being produced, its translation was not producing good value for money and as such was halted.

Our invaluable *project chronicler*, **bee**, has been keeping a meticulous record of the translation effort in our [**translation index**](https://github.com/decredcommunity/translations/blob/master/index.md). Though not ideal at tracking either software or video translations, it does give the reader a very good idea of how much work has been done. Please keep in mind, however, that it is a **general** translation index, whose scope is much greater than only listing the output for this proposal. For this reason, please be mindful of the dates when each translation piece was submitted, as only the ones between May 2022 - Dec 2022 fall under the purview and funding of the Decred Content and Asset Translation Proposal (Phase 3).


## Why

As stated earlier, the goals and rationale for this proposal mostly stay the same, that is to say the general focus is to provide better access to Decred content for non-English speakers, or at least a better entry point for those who are not comfortable with English outside the scope of most basic conversational utility, thus potentially increasing the reach of the project's message and further building out its recognition (please see the corresponding section of the [first proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/c093b8a)).

Once again, though I think it is important to keep the non-English speaking community abreast of developments in the Decred ecosystem as well as we can, I wish to stress the utmost importance of making Decred's flagship pieces of software, such as **wallets**, the **DCRDEX**, and potentially (project ownership and implementation permitting) the newest addition to the suite of software relying on the Decred ecosystem, **Bison Relay** as approachable and easy to use for all the participants in the Decred network.


## How

The proposal asks for a discretionary budget for translation in a few recognised areas, such as:

- The [Decred Journal](https://xaur.github.io/decred-news/) (continuous)
- Website translation (as required)
- Software localisation (Decrediton, DCRDEX, mobile wallets, etc., at the contributor's discretion)
- Video assets translation (at the contributor's discretion)
- Articles/content translation (at the contributor's discretion)

Even though the output is not likely to be consistent in all areas due to their nature, we still stick by the original areas that were identified at the very beginning and would like to include them in this phase of the proposal. The reason for this is that, if approved, the proposal and its budget will account for the whole of 2023, and with content being produced by other approved proposals we would like to keep as many options open to bring it to new audiences.


## Who

One significant departure from the way things were done with regards to contributing personnel I would like to propose is dispensing with the "previously approved" list for several reasons.

Firstly, it created a false impression, despite communicating that we're open to new contributors, that the people listed were the only ones sanctioned to work on translations in their listed languages, which to some might have acted as a potential barrier to entry. Additionally, this may have even contributed to some "sanctioned" personnel unfortunately becoming complacent and, as evident from their billing patterns, contributing a less polished product and/or overbilling for their work, which has led to their dismissal from the proposal.

Secondly, with other proposals (chiefly Decred Magazine) making successful use of the "temporary contractor" functionality of Decred's Contractor Management System it is no longer required to develop a long track record with contributing to the project (although it is still very welcome and builds more confidence in the prospective contributor), and as long as the criteria of availability for translation maintenance (which is preferable in the case of software translations) and translation accuracy are satisfied, the contributors can expect to get onboarded with much less friction.


## When

The proposal would cover translation efforts the year 2023, to be evaluated and submitted for renewal in late 2023/early 2024.


## Budget

Based on past billing history we propose that the proposal be allocated a budget of **USD 33,000** for its duration to provide a comfortable buffer against overspending despite a history of staying under budget to date.

We are confident that our past spending is an accurate enough of a guideline to prevent us from going (significantly, but hopefully at all) over budget in 2023. As always, it needs to be stressed that this is a **projected maximum budget** with the actual spending hopefully being much less, as indicated by past performance.

As always **all funds not spent by the proposal will remain in the project Treasury**.

Thank you very much for your time and attention and look forward to a fruitful discussion. As always, all constructive feedback is very welcome and appreciated.
