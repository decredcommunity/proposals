## Summary

In short: the product was delivered and the budget was met with ~$28,400 billed out of the $39,000 limit.

[Decred Journal 2021](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/1d74b88) proposal was approved on Feb 21, 2021 and authorized billable work between Jan 1 and Dec 31, 2021, in order to produce Decred Journal and Politeia Digest (translations not included).


## Deliverables

12 issues of Decred Journal were published on Medium [Decred](https://medium.com/decred) account, [GitHub](https://xaur.github.io/decred-news/) and some other platforms (see full [list of mirrors](https://xaur.github.io/decred-news/mirrors)).

10 issues of Politeia Digest were published on Medium [Politeia Digest](https://medium.com/politeia-digest) account and on [Block Commons](https://blockcommons.red/politeia-digest/).


## Expenses

| Politeia Digest spent           |  ~$3,600 |
| Proposal spend 1 mo avg         |   $2,367 |
| Total spent                     | ~$28,400 |

| Total spent % of limit          |    72.8% |

While the figures are in USD, actual payments were made in DCR via Decred Contractor Management System (CMS), at monthly average DCR/USD rates which varied between $54.25-$198.60 (average $131).


## Problems

1. Late releases due to my sub-optimal time management. Best release day was 8th, worst 15th, average 13th.

2. Unpaid January work due to my incorrect selection of the billable end date. I advocate for [fixed billable work periods](https://github.com/decred/politeia/issues/1569) to increase accountability and further automate Politeia and treasury management. In the proposal I explicitly stated that its budget can be used for work done between 2021-Jan-01 and 2021-Dec-31. What I missed is that most of the work for the December issue was done in January 2022 and would need to go in January invoices at January's DCR/USD rate. This has resulted in ~20 hours of work getting unpaid, as we have agreed to not bill for it to respect the terms of the proposal. Thanks to this experience a similar bug was found and fixed in the 2022 proposal.


## Notable developments

- We stopped mirroring DJ on CoinMarketCap after [December 2020](https://coinmarketcap.com/headlines/signals/decred-journal-december-2020-decred/) issue, once CMC stopped handling that much text and proper Markdown. However, we still post [DJ announcements](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/decred/news/) on CMC with highlights and a link to full text, e.g. this is how [April 2022](https://coinmarketcap.com/gravity/articles/28375) looks.

- We stopped doing the [Publish0x mirror](https://www.publish0x.com/decredjournal) after the October issue due to hassles with their text editor and low perceived value of posting on that platform. As a byproduct of posting ~14 issues on Publish0x, @richardred has earned a coffee or even a pizza worth of tips.

- We started posting DJ in [Decred Odysee account](https://odysee.com/@Decred:c) since [November 2021](https://odysee.com/@Decred:c/decred-journal-2021-11:3) issue. It is a promising platform backed by the (semi?) decentralized LBRY network. Originally it was only a mirror of Decred's YouTube channel, but since it also supports text posts we're giving it a go. If you have LBC, please consider supporting [Decred content](https://odysee.com/@Decred:c) by staking LBC in it!

- A new [#services](https://chat.decred.org/#/room/#services:decred.org) Matrix room was started as a yet another byproduct of DJ. Post any news about the Decred ecosystem (exchanges, payment processors, VSPs - anything) and it will flow into the next DJ issue.

- Another byproduct was [monthly reports](https://decredcommunity.github.io/social-media-stats/) on Decred's social media performance. Formally it was part of the [research](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/020b8b0) proposal but DJ triggered their creation. I wrote 5 reports as an experiment but ultimately stopped for low perceived value.

- I started putting DJ image assets in a new GitHub [repository](https://github.com/xaur/decred-journal-files) to have one well-known and replicated place for all images for all target platforms. This includes exclusive title art images by @saender, and all other images posted in DJ.

- Documentation has been continuosly improved, most notably the [Guidelines](https://github.com/xaur/decred-news/blob/docs/guidelines.md), [Sources](https://github.com/xaur/decred-news/blob/docs/sources.md), [Release checklist](https://github.com/xaur/decred-news/blob/docs/release-checklist-template.md), and of course our epic [template](https://github.com/xaur/decred-news/blob/docs/journal-template.md).

- @bochinchero started contributing chart images for Network and Markets sections to make the numbers more entertaining. Notably, both [images](https://github.com/bochinchero/dcrsnapshots) and [source code](https://github.com/bochinchero/decredonchain) to generate them are openly available.

- Overall style and formatting has evolved to help readability: we got a table of contents, short project descriptions in Development, more images, better wording here and there, etc..

- In December 2021 issue I [announced](https://xaur.github.io/decred-news/journal/202112#the-future-of-decred-journal) that DJ will be paused due to my lack of time and energy to continue. Luckily, @Exitus picked it up in April 2022. Check out the [2022 proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/record/4fdef29)!


## Closing words

I apologize for writing this report so late. The right time to publish it was February 2022 after final payments for the proposal have been settled.

[Thank you](https://xaur.github.io/decred-news/testimonials) to all readers, stakeholders, and contributors for making Decred Journal what it is today!
