      - If this passes, all the people who have locked funds they cannot access due to losing their redeem script will have access to their funds again!
      - the change also mean tickets which expire will be available 1 block earlier

      After the auto revoke is implemented it will drastically simplify ticket splitting, as well as removing the possibility of the "fee drain" attack.

      A lot of the faff was making sure any of the participants could revoke the ticket if it was missed, to avoid locking up their coins forever.

    quote: It doesn't "solve" the fee drain attack because purchasing the ticket itself costs atoms (so purchasing a ticket that will never vote is a net loss every time). But it does make it strictly safer to perform the splits, since it guarantees you'll never lose access to your funds.
