- Source files are published [here](https://github.com/xaur/decred-news) for DJ and [here](https://github.com/RichardRed0x/politeia-digest) for PD. Archivists can use Git to clone the repositories for additional protection against data loss.

Byproducts:

- Monthly updates of [decred.org/news](https://decred.org/news/) page. It was [suggested](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pull/1084#issuecomment-1259104449) to expand the Journal workflow to also submit best media stories to the News page, and it [has been done](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/pulls?q=is%3Apr+news) since November 2022.
- Network data collection automation ([dcrsnapcsv](https://github.com/bochinchero/dcrsnapcsv))
- Chart generation code ([decredonchain](https://github.com/bochinchero/decredonchain))
- Chart images in 3 sizes, reusable way beyond DJ ([dcrsnapshots](https://github.com/bochinchero/dcrsnapshots))
- More detailed news about ecosystem members (exchanges, wallets, etc.) are posted in the [#ecosystem](https://chat.decred.org/#/room/#ecosystem:decred.org) chat room.
- More detailed reports about attended events are published in the [events index](https://decredcommunity.github.io/events/index/).
- Social media stats collection has continued in the corresponding [repository](https://github.com/decredcommunity/social-media-stats). Not many code/chart updates so far but the raw data is still updated monthly and is free for reuse.


## Expenses

| Item                                  | Units | Unit avg. | Spent    | Limit     |
|---------------------------------------|------:|----------:|---------:|----------:|
| Compensation for Jan 2022             |     1 |     ~$930 |    ~$930 |    $1,000 |
| Decred Journal issues (202204-202212) |     9 |   ~$2,570 | ~$23,120 |   $27,000 |
| Politeia Digest issues (51-56)        |     6 |     ~$250 |  ~$1,520 |    $4,950 |
| Proposal spending monthly             |     9 |   ~$2,740 | ~$24,640 |   $31,950 |
| Proposal total                        |       |           | ~$25,570 |   $33,000 |

Notes:

- Total proposal expense of **$25,570** was **77%** of the **$33,000** limit. For comparison, the [2021 proposal](https://github.com/decredcommunity/proposals/blob/master/proposals/1d74b88/updates/20220521.md) spent 73% of its $39,000 limit. We believe the limit was again chosen well and 20-30% is a reasonable buffer to account for any unforeseen expenses.

- Proposal's monthly burn rate varied between ~$2,100 and ~$3,200. The average for 9 active months was $2,740. It was $370 higher than the $2,370 average for 2021, mainly due to extra hours for knowledge transfer and automating chart generation.

- Politeia Digest spent ~$1,520 or just 31% of its limit, or 6% of the total expense. It was significantly less than expected because there was less Politeia activity to cover than we planned for. This is much harder to predict than Decred Journal expenses.

- We had 3 hard limits: proposal total $33,000, monthly limit for DJ at $3,000, and monthly limit for PD at $550. The limit for DJ was exceeded by ~$200 in 1 month and met in 8 other months. PD met the limit in all months and the proposal total was met as well. Moving forward we plan to keep only one "hard" limit for proposal's total expenses and relax the monthly ones to "soft" limits for greater flexibility.

- Jan 2022 item is presented separately because it does not cover a full DJ issue and so it is not included in the min/max/average stats. It paid for completing the December 2021 issue in January (which was not billed from the 2021 proposal due to poor choice of its end date).

- Start Date in the proposal header was incorrectly set to 2022-05-28 because Politeia [did not allow](https://github.com/decred/politeia/issues/1569) to set Start Date in the past. We assume that dates specified in the proposal text take precedence over those in the header. The correct billable work dates for this proposal were 2022-Jan-01 to 2023-Jan-31.

- While all figures here are in USD, actual payments were made in DCR via Decred Contractor Management System (CMS), at monthly average DCR/USD rates which varied between $19.79 and $62.63 (average $30.52).


## Things to improve

Our main challenge remains late releases of Decred Journal. Best release day was 15th, worst 21th, average 18th. It got worse compared to 2021: best 8th, worst 15th, average 13th.

The problem comes from not having enough hours to cover all activity, unpredictable availability of hours, and not-good-enough management of these two factors. We really don't want to miss stuff and choose to include more stories, at the cost of releasing later. It means DJ is not the best vehicle for fresh news. Luckily [Twitter](https://twitter.com/decredproject), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@DecredTV) and [Decred Magazine](https://www.decredmagazine.com/) do a good job of posting news earlier. We believe DJ is still a powerful monthly resource for following most Decred activity in one place and discovering updates not found elsewhere. At the same time we are looking how to fix the schedule.

Politeia Digest was unaffected by this and was quite the opposite. Each release was well coordinated with a proposal batch going to vote, giving voters a concise summary of relevant proposals when it was most useful.


## Notable changes

- Budget limit for 2022 proposal was $33,000, reduced from $39,000 in the [2021 proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/1d74b88). This was due to covering only 9 months instead of full 12 months. Ideally it should be standard 12 months in future proposals to have yearly numbers to compare.

- We have replaced title images from @saender with cheaper ones to reduce overall production costs.

- @bochinchero automated more of the data collection for Network and Markets sections, added new charts and improved existing charts.

- We were adding even more images, up to 14 in the most image-rich DJ issues, mainly thanks to the new charts. Hopefully this is more informative and entertaining.

- New projects have been added to Development coverage, most notably Bison Relay.

- Supporting [docs](https://github.com/xaur/decred-news/tree/docs) continued to evolve to help us not forget stuff, mainly our [epic template](https://github.com/xaur/decred-news/blob/docs/journal-template.md). Guidelines and tips for [publishing on various platforms](https://github.com/decredcommunity/outreach/blob/release/docs/platforms.md) have been extracted to be reused beyond DJ.

- @phoenixgreen has been publishing [Decred Journal](https://www.decredmagazine.com/tag/decred-journal/) and [Politeia Digest](https://www.decredmagazine.com/tag/politeia-digest/) on [Decred Magazine](https://www.decredmagazine.com/) and it became the primary target for DJ. Decred Magazine is powered by [Ghost](https://ghost.org/), looks good on mobile, has very lightweight pages, handles image optimization, and generates previews that look nice on Twitter, meaning we no longer need to manually add an image to the tweet.

- We stopped publishing DJ on [Odysee](https://odysee.com/@Decred:c). After Decred Magazine became our primary target we decided it is safe to remove Odysee and save us from the work to manually work-around a few Markdown issues in Odysee's blog posts.
