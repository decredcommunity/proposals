(below is a quote from Phase 3 proposal)

## Metrics from Phase 2

| YouTube Metric | 6 Month Value |
|----------------|--------------:|
| Views          |        23,836 |
| Like %         |         99.2% |
| Subs Gained    |           504 |
| Subs Lost      |           236 |
| New Comments   |           193 |

Last phase saw a small increase in views and engagement. I attribute this to the exchange rate increase and the impressive 1.6 release which has generated increased interest.

The highest viewed [News video](https://youtu.be/hRvGHhGx-Fg) on YouTube received 1,516 hits, and the [Privacy Tutorial](https://youtu.be/QC65PBNwAK4) has nearly 1,000 hits, which I believe has contributed to the high privacy participation rate with over 5.5 million (43%) of Decred in a [mixed output](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/charts?chart=coin-supply&zoom=jxs79pcz-kttb78n7&bin=day&axis=time&visibility=true-true-true).

I believe the real action will start once Decred gets listed on larger fiat exchanges, or once the DEX is user-friendly with stable coin pairs - whatever comes first.
