Here's a summary of the work done over the proposal period. Keeping it somewhat lightweight to be digestible, if any comments please leave here.

## UI/UX

The bulk of the efforts have gone towards establishing a more open and accessible workflow at Figma. We've also worked towards consolidating Decrediton with pi-ui components, as seen on the key views examples. For other tasks, there are several UX improvement concepts created for Decrediton as listed in the prop, as well as some in-progress concept design work for Politeia.

dcrweb got design support for the 1.6 release and DCRDEX subpage, other-regarding subpages, most of the subpage related and smaller issues were not addressed.

dcrandroid, dcrios, and additionally requested work on godcr have received a number of UI and interaction improvements, as well as contextual and prototyped examples and as listed in Morphy's worklog.

CMS items were not addressed.

@kyle [commented](https://github.com/decred/dcrdesign/issues/252#issuecomment-800561295) on "Identity / Staking onboarding graphics and motion assets":

The existing plan is to use the most refined @lustosa "Ticket Lifecycle" for a Proof of Concept and to test out as a prototype now the UI mockups exist in the Figma prior to development of other concepts explored in Boords.

These still haven't been migrated to Figma and still currently exist as Boords. Links to the Boords are below.

Obviously all copy here is WIP and copy placeholders are mainly from dcrdocs:
