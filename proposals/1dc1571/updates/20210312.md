Here’s a summary of the work done over the proposal period.  Keeping it somewhat lightweight to be digestible, if any comments please leave here.
 
## UIUX

The bulk of the efforts have gone towards establishing a more open and accessible workflow at Figma. We've also worked towards consolidating Decrediton with pi-ui components, as seen on the key views examples. For other tasks, there are several UX improvement concepts created for Decrediton as listed in the prop, as well as some in-progress concept design work for Politeia.

Dcrweb got design support for the 1.6 release and DCRDEX subpage, other-regarding subpages, most of the subpage related and smaller issues were not addressed.

Dcrandroid, ios, and additionally requested work on godcr have received a number of UI and interaction improvements as well contextual and prototyped examples and as listed in Morphy's worklog.

CMS items were not addressed.
